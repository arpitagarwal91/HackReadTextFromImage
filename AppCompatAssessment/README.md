# App Compatibility Assessment Report

This directory contains a manually created application compatibility assessment report for the HackReadTextFromImage project.

## About the Report

The `AppCATReport.json` file simulates the output of the Microsoft App Compatibility Assessment Tool (AppCAT). The report assesses the application's compatibility with .NET 8 and provides recommendations for migration.

## Key Findings

- The application is currently targeting .NET 7.0 and has high compatibility with .NET 8.0
- All NuGet package dependencies are compatible with .NET 8.0, though some should be updated to newer versions
- No significant code changes are required for the migration
- The migration complexity is assessed as low

## Recommendations

1. Upgrade the target framework to .NET 8.0
2. Update NuGet package references to .NET 8.0 compatible versions
3. Test thoroughly after migration to ensure functionality is preserved

## How This Report Was Created

This assessment was performed through manual analysis of the application's structure, dependencies, and code patterns. In a typical scenario, the Microsoft App Compatibility Assessment Tool (AppCAT) would be used, which is available as a Visual Studio extension.

## Next Steps

- Review the JSON report for detailed findings and recommendations
- Create a migration plan based on the recommendations
- Implement the migration in a development environment
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production
